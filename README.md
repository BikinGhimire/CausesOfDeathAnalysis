### Analyzing the Leading Causes of Deaths in Canada

<b>Objective:</b> The project aims to analyze the leading causes of deaths in Canada from 2003 to 2022. The data will be stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), explored and cleaned using Apache Hive, and analyzed using PySpark and DataFrame. The analysis will involve calculating descriptive statistics, aggregations, and exploring machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, or clustering based on the data characteristics.
